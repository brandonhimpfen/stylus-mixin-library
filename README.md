## How-to-Use

Copy the mixins folder to your project directory and then add the following line of code to your project's main file:

```
@import 'mixins/*'
```

## Examples

Each mixin file located in the mixins directory contains documentation on how to include the mixin.

Example of implementation can also be found in `test.styl`.
